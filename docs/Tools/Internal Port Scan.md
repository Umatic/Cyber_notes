It has been identified on **[hh:mm dd/mm/yy] GMT+`[Timezone]`** that an internal port scan was detected, originating from the following host:

* Hostname: **[Enter Hostname]**
* Username: **[Enter Username]**
* Source IP: **[Enter Source IP]**
* MAC Address: **[Enter MAC Address]**

The scan targeted a range of ports, attempting to find open services. The following details were recorded:

* Destination IP: **[Enter Destination IP]**
* Ports Targeted: **[Enter Port Range or Specific Ports]**
* Number of Events Generated: **[Enter Number of Events]**
* Action Taken: **[Allowed/Denied/Dropped]**

Port scans are commonly used as a reconnaissance technique by attackers to identify services running on specific ports. By finding open ports, an attacker can determine which services or applications are available and possibly vulnerable to exploitation. While a single port scan might be part of normal network traffic, repeated or widespread scanning could indicate malicious intent or preparation for a more targeted attack.

Further investigation has revealed `[any additional findings, such as unusual traffic patterns, follow-up scans, EDR observations, or connections attempted prior and after the scan]`.

`If the we have access to client's EDR, but there is no EDR sensor on the host, state it.`
