Ping sweeps are a method used to discover which IP addresses within a network are live and responsive. Attackers typically use this technique as an initial step to map out the network and identify active hosts before proceeding with further scans or attacks. By understanding which devices are online, they can target specific hosts with additional reconnaissance or exploitation attempts.

Further investigation has revealed `[any additional findings, such as unusual traffic patterns, follow-up scans, EDR observations, or connections attempted prior and after the scan]`.

`If the we have access to client's EDR, but there is no EDR sensor on the host, state it.`

This activity has been reported by **[Device Name]** with IP **[Device IP]**
