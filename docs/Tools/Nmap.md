# Nmap
Nmap is a popular open-source network scanning tool used for security auditing and exploration of computer networks. It allows network administrators to discover hosts and services on a computer network, as well as create a map of the network topology.

Nmap uses a variety of techniques to scan a network, including host discovery, port scanning, and version detection. With host discovery, Nmap sends packets to the target network to determine which hosts are alive and available. Port scanning allows Nmap to determine which services are running on each host and which ports they are using. Version detection is used to determine the type and version of the service running on each port.

Nmap is highly customizable, and its features can be extended through various scripts and plugins. It also includes a variety of output formats, such as plain text, XML, and HTML, making it easy to integrate with other security tools and platforms.

Nmap is used by network administrators and security professionals to perform various tasks, such as vulnerability scanning, network mapping, and penetration testing. It can also be used by attackers to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities. Because of its power and versatility, it's important to use Nmap responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

In summary, Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, as well as create a map of the network topology. Its features can be extended through various scripts and plugins, and it's commonly used by security professionals for vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
