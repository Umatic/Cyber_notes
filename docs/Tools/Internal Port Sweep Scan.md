It has been identified on **[hh:mm dd/mm/yy] GMT+`[Timezone]`** that an internal port sweep scan was detected, originating from the following host:

* Hostname: **[Enter Hostname]**
* Username: **[Enter Username]**
* Source IP: **[Enter Source IP]**
* MAC Address: **[Enter MAC Address]**

The scan attempted to detect an open port on multiple hosts within the network. The following details were noted:

* Port Targeted: **[Enter Port Range or Specific Ports]**
* Destination IP Range: **[Enter Destination IP Range]**
* Number of Events Generated: **[Enter Number of Events]**
* Action Taken: **[Allowed/Denied/Dropped]**

A port sweep involves scanning the same port across multiple devices on a network. Attackers use this method to identify which hosts are running services on specific ports, potentially finding weaker or unpatched systems. If a vulnerable service is found on a host, it could be exploited to gain unauthorized access or disrupt operations.

Further investigation has revealed `[any additional findings, such as unusual traffic patterns, follow-up scans, EDR observations, or connections attempted prior and after the scan]`.

`If the we have access to client's EDR, but there is no EDR sensor on the host, state it.`
