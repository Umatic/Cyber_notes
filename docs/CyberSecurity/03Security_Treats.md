By understanding these four main categories of security threats, organizations can develop a comprehensive security strategy that addresses a wide range of risks and threats. This can include implementing strong access controls, regular software updates and patches, physical security measures, and user awareness training.

## Malware

Malware, short for malicious software, is a type of software designed to damage or disrupt computer systems. Malware can take many forms, including viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and spyware.

## Network Attacks

Network attacks target vulnerabilities in network infrastructure to gain unauthorized access to systems, data, or resources. Examples include Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, and phishing attacks.

## Physical Threats

Physical threats include any action that can damage or disrupt physical assets, such as theft, vandalism, or sabotage. Physical threats can also include natural disasters, such as floods or fires.

## Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering attacks are designed to exploit human behavior and trust to gain unauthorized access to systems or resources. Examples include phishing scams, pretexting, and baiting.
