# Cyber Threat Intelligence

Cyber Threat Intelligence ( CTI ) or Threat Intelligence ( TI ) is the process of gathering and analyzing information about potential cyber threats to better understand and defend against them. It helps organizations detect, prevent, and respond to cyber attacks more effectively by providing actionable insights about attackers’ motivations, capabilities, and tactics. Cybersecurity professionals can prioritize their defenses and allocate resources strategically by answering questions such as:

* Who’s attacking you?

* What are their motivations?

* What are their capabilities?

* What artifacts and indicators of compromise (IOCs) should you look out for?

## CTI Sources

With these questions, threat intelligence would be gathered from different sources under the following categories:

* **Internal:** Corporate security events such as vulnerability assessments and incident response reports.
Cyber awareness training reports.
System logs and events.

* **External:** Threat Intel feeds (Commercial & Open-source)
Online marketplaces.
Public sources include government data, publications, social media, financial and industrial assessments.

* **Community:** Open web forums.
Dark web communities for cybercriminals.
