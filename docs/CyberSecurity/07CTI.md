# Cyber Threat Intelligence

Cyber Threat Intelligence ( CTI ) or Threat Intelligence ( TI ) is the process of gathering and analyzing information about potential cyber threats to better understand and defend against them. It helps organizations detect, prevent, and respond to cyber attacks more effectively by providing actionable insights about attackers’ motivations, capabilities, and tactics. Cybersecurity professionals can prioritize their defenses and allocate resources strategically by answering questions such as:

* Who’s attacking you?

* What are their motivations?

* What are their capabilities?

* What artifacts and indicators of compromise (IOCs) should you look out for?

## CTI Sources

With these questions, threat intelligence would be gathered from different sources under the following categories:

* **Internal:** Corporate security events such as vulnerability assessments and incident response reports.
Cyber awareness training reports.
System logs and events.

* **External:** Threat Intel feeds (Commercial & Open-source)
Online marketplaces.
Public sources include government data, publications, social media, financial and industrial assessments.

* **Community:** Open web forums.
Dark web communities for cybercriminals.

## CTI Categorizing Factors

To categorize these sources, CTI analysts may consider several factors, including:

* **Reliability:** The trustworthiness and accuracy of the source of the intelligence. This can be evaluated based on the reputation of the source and its track record of providing reliable and accurate information.

* **Relevancy:** The degree to which the intelligence is relevant to the specific threat landscape and needs of the organization. This can be influenced by factors such as industry, business model, and geographic location.

* **Timeliness:** The speed with which the intelligence can be obtained and acted upon. This is particularly important for threat intelligence, as timely up-to-date information can be used to detect and respond to threats more effectively.

* **Actionability:** The usefulness of the intelligence for taking proactive measures to defend against threats. This can include providing specific guidance on how to mitigate risks and improve security posture.

## Cyber Threat intelligence Classification

Cyber Threat intelligence can be classified into the following categories:

* **Strategic Intelligence:** High-level intelligence that examines an organization's threat landscape and maps out risk areas based on trends, patterns, and emerging threats that may impact business decisions.

* **Technical Intelligence:** Examines evidence and artifacts of attacks used by adversaries. Incident response teams can use this intelligence to create a baseline attack surface for analyzing and developing defense mechanisms.

* **Tactical Intelligence:** Assesses adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This intelligence can strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations.

* **Operational Intelligence:** Examines an adversary's specific motives and intent to perform an attack. Security teams may use this intelligence to understand the critical assets available in the organization (people, processes, and technologies) that may be targeted.
