# Threat Actors

The main categories of threat actors can be broadly classified as follows:

## Script Kiddies

These are typically inexperienced individuals who use pre-existing hacking tools or scripts to launch attacks on computer systems without fully understanding the technical details behind them. They may be motivated by a desire to show off their skills or simply to cause mischief.

## Hacktivists

These are individuals or groups who engage in hacking as a form of political activism or to advance a social cause. They often target government agencies, corporations, or organizations that they feel are acting unjustly or engaging in unethical practices. Hacktivist attacks may include defacing websites, stealing sensitive information, or disrupting operations.

## Organized Crime

These are groups or individuals who engage in hacking as a means of making money. They may use sophisticated techniques to steal financial data, personally identifiable information, or intellectual property, which they can then sell on the black market.

## Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

These are typically state-sponsored or state-affiliated groups that use advanced techniques to infiltrate an organization's systems and steal sensitive information over a long period of time. APTs may use social engineering, zero-day vulnerabilities, or spear phishing attacks to gain access to a target's network, and once they have established a foothold, they may remain hidden for months or even years while they exfiltrate data.
