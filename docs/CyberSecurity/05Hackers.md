# Hacker types

There are various types of hackers, each with different motivations and techniques. It's important to note that not all hackers are criminals, and some can even be beneficial in identifying security weaknesses and improving security systems. However, those who engage in malicious activities pose a significant threat to individuals, organizations, and governments, and it's important to take steps to protect against their attacks.

## White Hat Hackers

## Black Hat Hackers
