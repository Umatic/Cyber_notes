# MITRE

MITRE Corporation, commonly referred to as simply "MITRE," is a not-for-profit organization that operates multiple federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) in the United States. MITRE serves as a trusted advisor to the U.S. government, providing technical expertise and solutions to address complex challenges in various domains, including cybersecurity, defense, healthcare, aviation, and more.

### APT

APT stands for Advanced Persistent Threat. It refers to a sophisticated and targeted cyber attack carried out by skilled and well-funded adversaries, typically with a specific objective in mind, such as stealing sensitive information, disrupting critical systems, or conducting espionage. APTs are characterized by their stealthy and persistent nature, often involving a prolonged and covert presence within a targeted network or system, with the aim of evading detection and maintaining access over an extended period of time.

### TTP

TTP stands for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, and each term has its own meaning:

* Tactic: Refers to the adversary's goal or objective.  
* Technique: Describes how the adversary achieves the goal or objective.  
* Procedure: Outlines how the technique is executed.  

### ATT&CK® framework

The ATT&CK® framework, developed by MITRE, is a globally-accessible knowledge base that documents adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It originated in 2013 as an internal project called FMX (Fort Meade Experiment) to record and document TTPs used by APT groups against enterprise Windows networks. Over the years, the ATT&CK® framework has expanded to cover other platforms like macOS and Linux, and it is continuously updated with contributions from various sources, including security researchers and threat intelligence reports. The framework is utilized not only by blue teamers for defensive purposes but also by red teamers for offensive operation
