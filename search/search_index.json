It also includes a variety of output formats, such as plain text, XML, and HTML, making it easy to integrate with other security tools and platforms.</p> <p>Nmap is used by network administrators and security professionals to perform various tasks, such as vulnerability scanning, network mapping, and penetration testing. It can also be used by attackers to identify potential targets and vulnerabilities. Because of its power and versatility, it's important to use Nmap responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p> <p>In summary, Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, as well as create a map of the network topology. Its features can be extended through various scripts and plugins, and it's commonly used by security professionals for vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.</p>"},{"location":"Tools/Phishing%20Mail/","title":"Phishing Mail","text":"<p>It has been identified on [hh:mm dd/mm/yy] GMT+<code>[Timezone]</code> that a phishing email was detected targeting the following user:</p> <ul> <li>Recipient Name: [Enter Recipient Name]</li> <li>Recipient Email: [Enter Recipient Email]</li> </ul> <p>The following details were extracted from the phishing email:</p> <ul> <li>Subject: [Enter Email Subject]</li> <li>Sender Email: [Enter Sender Email]</li> <li>Attached Files: [Enter File Names if any]</li> <li>Links Included: [Enter URLs or Descriptions of Links]</li> </ul> <p>Phishing emails are designed to deceive recipients into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware.
